                        <h4>The Legality of Playwin Fantasy in India</h4>
                       
                        <p>Playwin Fantasy takes great care to comply with all central and state legislation in India to ensure that our users are fully protected. All contests on our platform are carefully designed to comply with applicable statutes and regulations in India.</p>
                        
                                <p>Below are the key points from a High Court’s judgement regarding the Playwin Fantasy game:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>  -	The Court, in its ruling, stated that playing the Playwin Fantasy game involves considerable skill, judgement and discretion and that success on Dream11 arises out of users’ exercise, 	</li>
                        </ul>
                      
                        <p>superior knowledge, judgment and attention</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>-	The Court also held that ‘the element of skill’ had a predominant influence on the outcome of the Playwin Fantasy game, which follows the following format:</li>
                                    <li>-	Participants have to choose a team consisting of at least the same no. of players as playing in a real-life sports team (e.g. 5 in basketball, 7 in kabaddi and 11 in cricket/football)</li>
                                            <li>-	All contests are run for at least the duration of one full sports match</li>
                                                    <li>-	No team changes are allowed by participants after the start of the sports match</li>
                                                    </ul>
                            <p>On this basis, the Court adjudged that playing on Playwin Fantasy constitutes a ‘game of mere skill’, which makes the Dream11 game exempt from the provisions of the Public Gam	
                            bling Act, 1867 (PGA)</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>-	Finally, the Court held that the Dream11 game is not a gambling activity and is a legitimate business activity protected under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India</li>
                                </ul>
